                        Recently we sent you an invitation to participate in a survey being conducted by Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand, Health Education England and Cass Business School about the experienced wellbeing of Wessex junior doctors during their working day.
                    </p>

                    <p style="color:#008080;font-size:18px;">
                        You have been invited to participate in this anonymous study as a current trainee of Health Education England working across Wessex. Your response is important to us. You will help us learn about the wellbeing of junior doctors.
                    </p>

                    <p style="color:#008080;font-size:18px">
                        As part of the study, we would like to ask you some questions about yourself and your work situation. We will then ask follow up questions on the tasks that you perform during the day and how you feel about them.
                    </p>

                    <p style="color:#008080;font-size:18px">
                        We estimate that the initial survey will take 10-12 minutes. Follow up surveys will occur five times over the next week and will track your work tasks and wellbeing. An additional survey, the MyWorkplace survey, lasting 10-15 minutes will ask you how you feel about your place of work and supervision.
